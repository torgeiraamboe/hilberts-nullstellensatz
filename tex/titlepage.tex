    This short write-up was written during a graduate course on commutative algebra at NTNU. 
    We used the book by Atiyah and MacDonald, and exercise 7.14 is to prove the strong Hilbert's nullstellensatz. 
    I wanted to thoroughly go through a proof, 
    including lemmas used in the proof to have an almost selfcontained overview of the problem. 
    It turned into this little write-up.
